		<h1>The Giant Squid</h1>

<p>The <dfn title="(genus: Architeuthis)">giant squid</dfn> is a deep-ocean dwelling squid in the family Architeuthidae, represented by as many as eight species.
 	Giant squid can grow to a tremendous size (see Deep-sea gigantism): recent estimates put the maximum size at 13 m (43 ft) for females and 10 m (33 ft) 
 	for males from the posterior fins to the tip of the two long tentacles
  	(second only to the colossal squid at an estimated 14 m (46 ft), one of the largest living organisms).
  	The mantle is about 2 m (6.6 ft) long (more for females, less for males), and the length of the squid excluding its tentacles is about 5 m (16 ft). 
 	Claims of specimens measuring 20 m (66 ft) or more have not been scientifically documented.
	On 30 September 2004, researchers from the <abbr title="(Museum of Nature and Science)">NMNS</abbr> of Tokyo, Japan
	and the <dfn title="Ogasawara Whale Watching Association">OWA</dfn> took the first images of a live giant squid in its natural habitat.
	Several of the 556 photographs were released a year later.
 	The NMNS and OWA successfully filmed a live adult giant squid for the first time on 4 December 2006.
