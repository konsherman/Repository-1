	<h1>Shaolin Yokobue</h1>
	
	<p>The first desin i picked was called Shaolin Yokobue. while going threw all the the designs this was the first one to catch my eye. I like how simple it is but the graphics look very well made. the way its designed it brings your eye right down the page.  While reviewing the CSS code it looks like some pretty basic stuff compared to some of the other sites i have looks at on here. All around good design i like this one!</p>
	
	
	<h1>Leggo My Ego</h1>
	
	<p>This design i really like. really fun page to look at with all the leggos. other than the cool looking graphics its pretty basic for the most part.</p>
	
	
	
	<h1>Under the sea</h1>
	
	<p>This design is really cool once again the graphics are very pleasing to the eye. i like how its got pictures as like a footer type thing that doesn't move as you scroll down. that might be anoying to some people i really like it. Other than that it seems like a easy site to make other than the graphics.</p>
